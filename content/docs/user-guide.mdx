## Welcome to LangQuest

**Every Language. Every Culture.**

LangQuest is an app where you can collect text and audio language data quickly. It's **local-first** - meaning you can work offline and then sync to the cloud when connected. You can **collaborate with teammates**, **translate**, and **validate** within the community.

### Our Vision

Our vision is that **every language would have access to the world's knowledge** and **every culture would be able to share its meaning with the world**.

## What You Can Record

LangQuest is designed for collecting various types of content:

### 📖 Bible Content

You can record a Bible or any books of the Bible. Bible content is **structured as books** (like Genesis or Matthew). When you click on a chapter, it becomes a **quest** that you can work on to collect that data.

### 📚 Other Content

Beyond the Bible, you can record:
- **Folk tales**
- **Folklore**
- **Traditional stories**
- **Cultural content**
- Any other oral or written content you want to preserve

---

## How to Collect Data

### Recording Mechanics

To collect audio data in LangQuest:

1. **Hold the button to record** - Press and hold the record button while speaking
2. **Slide to record** - Alternatively, slide the button to lock recording mode
3. **Speech detection** - The app uses speech detection to capture your voice clearly

Each recording creates a small asset that represents that specific piece of content (like a verse or story segment).

## Understanding Projects

### Your Project List

When you view your projects, you'll see:

- **Local projects** - Projects stored on your device
- **Cloud projects** - Projects synced to the cloud
- **Public domain projects** - Community projects you can explore

### Project Types

Projects are displayed with visual indicators:

- **Bible icon** 📖 - Indicates a Bible translation project
- **Crown icon** 👑 - Shows that you own this project
- **No special icon** - Other content projects (stories, folklore, etc.)

### Project Example

For instance, you might have:
- **"Curens Bible Project"** - with a Bible icon and crown (you own it)
- **"Stories Test"** - with a crown (you own it)
- **Public domain projects** - that you haven't been invited to and may have limited editing rights

---

## Working with Bible Projects

### Navigating Bible Content

1. **Select a Bible project** from your project list
2. **Browse the books of the Bible** (Genesis, Matthew, etc.)
3. **Select a book** to view its chapters
4. **Create a quest** by clicking on a chapter

### Recording Bible Verses

When you enter a quest (chapter):

1. If there are **no assets yet**, you'll see an empty state
2. Click the **record button** to begin
3. **Hold to record** individual verses:
   - "Matthew chapter 1 verse 1"
4. **Slide to record** multiple verses continuously:
   - "Matthew chapter 1 verse 2"
5. Each recording creates a **separate asset** per verse or segment

---

## Exploring Public Projects

### Browsing Community Projects

From your project list, you can see **public domain projects** available to explore:

- These projects are **not owned by you** (no crown icon)
- You **have not been invited** to these projects
- You may be able to **view or explore** them
- You may have **limited editing capabilities** depending on the project settings

---

1. **Invite others to collaborate** on your projects
2. **Team members receive notifications** when invited

4. **Work together** on collecting and validating language data

### Syncing to the Cloud

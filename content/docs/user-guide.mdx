## Welcome to LangQuest

**Every Language. Every Culture.**

The goal with LangQuest is for you to collect text and audio language data quickly, **local first on your phone**, and then you can sync when connected. You can **collaborate with team members**, **translate with them**, and **validate with them**.

### Our Vision

Our vision is **every language having access to the world's knowledge** and **sharing their cultures meaning with that world**.

## What You Can Record

You can record a Bible or any other content in LangQuest:

### 📖 Structured Content (Bible)

A Bible has **structured content** - it has books, and it has chapters. When you're recording structured content, **each chapter will become a quest** that you can work on.

### 📚 Unstructured Content

You can also create **unstructured** projects for content like:
- **Folktales**
- **Myths**
- **Poems**
- **Traditional stories**
- **Cultural content**
- Any other oral or written content you want to preserve

---

## How to Collect Data

### Recording Mechanics

To collect audio data in LangQuest, you have two options:

1. **Hold the button to record** - Press and hold the record button while speaking
2. **Slide to record anytime you talk** - Slide the button over and it will automatically record every time you speak using speech detection

Each recording creates an asset that represents that specific piece of content (like a verse or story segment).

---

## Understanding Projects

### Your Project List

When you view your projects, you'll see your local projects that you've created. You can create new projects at any time:

- **Unstructured projects** - For folktales, myths, poems, and similar content
- **Bible content projects** - For structured Bible translation work

### Project Types

Projects are displayed with visual indicators:

- **Bible icon** 📖 - Indicates a Bible translation project
- **Crown icon** 👑 - Shows that you own this project
- **No special icon** - Other content projects (stories, folklore, etc.)

### Working with Local Projects

Your projects start as **local projects** stored on your device. You can work on them offline and later upload specific chapters or content to the cloud when you want to collaborate with others.

---

## Working with Bible Projects

### Navigating Bible Content

1. **Select a Bible project** from your project list
2. **Browse the books of the Bible** (Genesis, Matthew, etc.)
3. **Select a book** to view its chapters
4. **Select a chapter** to create a quest

### Verse Labels (Experimental)

**Enable Verse Labels** is an experimental feature that helps organize Bible resources using verse labels. You can enable or disable it anytime in the settings menu.

With verse labels enabled, you can:
- **Select verse labels** before or during recording
- **Record specific verses** by choosing the verse label first
- **Start recording sessions** for specific verse ranges (e.g., Genesis 1:3 or Genesis 1:4)

### Starting a Recording Session

When you're ready to record:

1. Click **"Start a recording session"**
2. **Grant microphone permissions** if prompted
3. **Calibrate your microphone** - LangQuest will automatically adjust the sensitivity for your environment
   - ⚠️ **Important:** Remain as quiet as possible during calibration for best results

### Recording Bible Verses

In the recording view:

1. **Select verse labels** from the dropdown (you can change these while recording)
2. **Hold to record** individual verses, or **slide to record** and speak multiple verses
3. Each recording creates an **asset** labeled with the verse number
4. **Play back your recordings** to review them
5. **Select and delete** any assets you don't want

### Managing Assets

You can manage your recorded assets in several ways:

- **Merge recordings** - Select multiple assets and merge them. The audio segments will be combined into the first selected asset and the others will be deleted
- **Delete recordings** - Select and delete individual assets
- **Change verse labels** - Adjust the verse range for any asset

## Collaboration Features

### Working Together

You can work together with others on your projects:

1. **Invite others to collaborate** on your projects
2. **They'll receive a notification** when invited
3. **Projects will appear in their list** once they accept
4. **Work together** on collecting and validating language data

For more details on collaboration, check out the [Project Membership](/docs/project-membership) video.

### Uploading to the Cloud

Look for the **Cloud icon** in the top right corner of a quest. When you tap it:

- It will **create a permanent copy** of that chapter in the cloud
- This is for the purposes of **collaborating with team members**
- When you invite them to your project, **they'll be able to access this**
- This becomes the **common point of reference** for the project

**Note:** If you're just doing tests or learning how to use the app and haven't uploaded anything to the cloud yet, your project remains local on your device.

### Deleting All Assets

If you need to start over or remove test recordings:

1. Go to the **menu on the bottom left**
2. Tap the **boom icon** (delete all assets)
3. **Confirm the deletion** (this cannot be undone)

⚠️ **Warning:** Make sure you know what you're doing - this action cannot be undone!

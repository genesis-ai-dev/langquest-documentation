## Understanding Project Types and Ownership

### Public vs Private Projects

In LangQuest, projects come in two types:

- **Public Projects**: Indicated by no lock icon
  - Anyone can view the project
  - Anyone can contribute translations and votes
  - No membership required for participation

- **Private Projects**: Indicated by a lock icon
  - Anyone can view the project content
  - Only members and owners can contribute translations and votes
  - Membership required to participate actively

### Project Roles

There are two levels of project membership:

#### **Owners** (indicated by a badge icon)
- Create new content for the project
- Make the project public or private
- Extend invitations to other users
- Approve membership requests from other users
- Full administrative control

#### **Members** (indicated by a member icon)
- Vote on existing translations
- Contribute new translations
- Cannot modify project settings or manage other users

## Step-by-Step Membership Process

### 1. Viewing Private Projects as a Non-Member

When you're not a member of a private project:

- **Browse the project freely** - you can view all content, quests, and assets
- **Explore different sections** - the project structure is fully visible
- **Notice the lock icons** - these appear beside contribution buttons (recording, text translation)
- **Understand the limitations** - you can see everything but cannot contribute

### 2. Requesting Project Membership

To request membership in a private project:

- **Click on any locked contribution button** (recording or text translation)
- **Use the membership portal** that appears
- **Enable "Download project immediately"** toggle if you want to work offline once approved
- **Submit your membership request** - this will be sent to all project owners

### 3. Managing Membership Requests (For Project Owners)

When you receive a membership request:

- **Check your notifications** - go to the hamburger menu â†’ notifications
- **Review the request** - you'll see who requested to join your project
- **Make a decision** - choose to accept or decline the request
- **Process the request** - accepted members gain immediate access to contribute

### 4. Accessing Member Features

Once your membership is approved:

- **Contribution buttons unlock** - lock icons disappear from recording and text translation buttons
- **Access the membership modal** - view all project members and their roles
- **Start contributing** - begin adding translations and votes to the project

### 5. Viewing Project Membership

To see who's in a project:

- **Open the membership modal** - available to all project members
- **See all members** - owners and regular members are listed
- **Understand permissions** - note that only owners can invite new members

## Invitation System

### Sending Invitations (Project Owners Only)

Project owners can proactively invite users:

- **Access the membership modal** in your owned projects
- **Click the invite option** - only visible to project owners
- **Enter the user's email address**
- **Choose membership level** - select regular member or owner
- **Send the invitation** - the system handles delivery

#### Invitation Delivery:
- **Existing LangQuest users**: Receive immediate in-app notifications
- **New users**: Receive email invitations that activate once they create accounts

### Accepting Invitations

When you receive a project invitation:

- **Check your notifications** - invitations appear in your notification center
- **Review the project details** - understand what you're being invited to join
- **Choose download preferences** - decide if you want to download the project immediately
  - **Download enabled**: You can contribute offline
  - **Download disabled**: You can only contribute while online
- **Accept or decline** - make your decision and confirm

## Project Privacy Management

### Changing Project Privacy (Owners Only)

Project owners can modify privacy settings:

- **Access project settings** - click the settings cog icon
- **Toggle privacy status** - switch between public and private
- **Understand the impact**:
  - **Making private**: Only members can contribute (lock icon appears)
  - **Making public**: Anyone can contribute (lock icon disappears)

### Privacy Status Indicators

- **Lock icon on project card**: Indicates a private project
- **No lock icon**: Indicates a public project
- **Member/owner badges**: Show your role in each project

## Best Practices

### For Project Owners:
- **Review membership requests promptly** to keep contributors engaged
- **Be thoughtful about privacy settings** - consider your project's goals
- **Invite trusted contributors** to maintain quality
- **Use owner privileges wisely** - consider promoting active members to co-owners

### For Members:
- **Respect project privacy** - understand that private projects have membership requirements
- **Contribute meaningfully** once you gain access
- **Download projects** if you plan to work offline
- **Engage with notifications** - respond to invitations and requests promptly

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Can't Contribute to a Project?
- Check if the project is private (lock icon present)
- Ensure you're a member of the project
- Request membership if needed

### Not Receiving Invitations?
- Check your notification center in-app
- Verify your email address is correct
- Check spam folder for email invitations

### Can't Invite Members?
- Confirm you're a project owner (not just a member)
- Ensure you're accessing your own project's membership modal

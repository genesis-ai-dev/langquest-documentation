## Understanding Your Projects

When you open LangQuest, you'll see **"My Projects"** - these are the projects that you've created. You can create new projects at any time:

- **Unstructured projects** - Projects without chapter and verse segmenters or structure (like folktales, poems, stories)
- **Bible content projects** - Projects with structured content (books and chapters, like the Bible)

## Inviting Members to Your Projects

To invite others to help you with your quests:

### Step 1: Open the Members Menu

1. **Select the three-dot menu** in the **bottom right corner** of your project
2. **Select the members icon**

### Step 2: Invite by Email

You can invite other members according to the **email they used for signing up for LangQuest**.

⚠️ **Important:** It can't just be any email you have for that person - it has to be the **email they used when they signed up** for LangQuest.

### Step 3: Choose Member Role

When inviting, you can:
- **Invite as a regular member** - Can contribute to the project
- **Invite as owner** - Gives them admin and other authority

### Transferring Ownership

Once you have other members, you can **transfer ownership** - that's the little **king icon**. Transferring ownership gives them admin and other authority over the project.

## Requesting Membership in Public Projects

### Viewing Public Projects

1. Go to **"All Projects"** in LangQuest
2. Browse through the **public projects** available
3. Select a project that interests you

### How to Request Membership

To request membership in a public project:

1. **Open the project** you're interested in
2. **Select the three-dot menu** in the **bottom right corner**
3. **Go into the members section**
4. **Request membership**

This will send an email to the owner of the project, which they can review and **accept or reject** your membership request.

## Publishing Your Project to the Cloud

Before you can collaborate with others, you need to upload your project content to the cloud.

### Finding Your Assets

1. Go into your project and navigate to a quest with recordings
2. You'll see the assets (recordings) you've made

### Using the Cloud Icon

Look for the **cloud icon in the top right corner** next to the verse labels. When you tap it:

- This will **create a permanent copy** of that chapter (e.g., Genesis 1) in the cloud
- The content is saved to LangQuest's databases
- **Once saved, this version cannot be changed**, but you can create new versions later if needed by recording over them
- **If the parent book or project hasn't been saved to the cloud yet**, they will be saved automatically

This permanent copy is what allows your invited team members to access and collaborate on the project.

## Managing Membership Requests (For Project Owners)

When someone requests to join your project:

- You'll receive an **email notification**
- **Review the request** - see who wants to join your project
- **Accept or reject** the membership request
- Accepted members gain immediate access to contribute to the project

---

## Viewing Project Members

To see who's in a project:

1. **Open the project**
2. **Select the three-dot menu** in the bottom right corner
3. **Tap the members icon**
4. **See all members** - owners (with the king icon) and regular members are listed

Only owners can invite new members to the project.

## Summary

That's the basics of project membership in LangQuest:

### For Project Owners:
1. **Create your projects** (unstructured or Bible content)
2. **Publish to the cloud** using the cloud icon to create permanent copies
3. **Invite members** via the three-dot menu → members icon → invite by email
4. **Choose their role** - regular member or owner
5. **Transfer ownership** if needed using the king icon
6. **Manage requests** - accept or reject membership requests from others

### For Members:
1. **Browse public projects** in the "All Projects" section
2. **Request membership** via the three-dot menu → members section
3. **Wait for approval** - the owner will receive an email and can accept or reject your request
4. **Start contributing** once approved

Remember: You must use the **email address that the person signed up with** when inviting members - it can't just be any email you have for them.

## Understanding Project Membership

LangQuest handles project membership in **two different ways**:

1. **Requests for Membership** - Users can request to join projects
2. **Invitations for Membership** - Project owners can invite users to join

## Requesting Project Membership

There are **two different ways** to request membership in a project:

### Method 1: Request from All Projects View

1. **Go to "All Projects"** in your project list
2. **Find a project** you want to become a member of
3. **Select that project** to view its details
4. Look for the **request membership button** in the **top center of the screen**
5. **Click to request membership** from the project owner

### Method 2: Request from Project Menu

For public projects you're browsing:

1. **Open the project** you're interested in (for example, "QE India" project)
2. **Select the menu** in the **bottom right corner** of the screen
3. **Tap the membership icon** at the top of the menu
4. **Request membership** through this interface

## Understanding Project Types and Ownership

### Public vs Private Projects

In LangQuest, projects come in two types:

- **Public Projects**: Indicated by no lock icon
  - Anyone can view the project
  - Anyone can contribute translations and votes
  - No membership required for participation

- **Private Projects**: Indicated by a lock icon
  - Anyone can view the project content
  - Only members and owners can contribute translations and votes
  - Membership required to participate actively

### Project Roles

There are two levels of project membership:

#### **Owners** (indicated by a badge icon)
- Create new content for the project
- Make the project public or private
- Extend invitations to other users
- Approve membership requests from other users
- Full administrative control

#### **Members** (indicated by a member icon)
- Vote on existing translations
- Contribute new translations
- Cannot modify project settings or manage other users

### Managing Membership Requests (For Project Owners)

When you receive a membership request:

- **Check your notifications** - go to the hamburger menu → notifications
- **Review the request** - you'll see who requested to join your project
- **Make a decision** - choose to accept or decline the request
- **Process the request** - accepted members gain immediate access to contribute

### Accessing Member Features

Once your membership is approved:

- **Contribution buttons unlock** - lock icons disappear from recording and text translation buttons
- **Access the membership modal** - view all project members and their roles
- **Start contributing** - begin adding translations and votes to the project

### Viewing Project Membership

To see who's in a project:

- **Open the project menu** (bottom right corner)
- **Tap the membership icon** (at the top of the menu)
- **See all members** - owners and regular members are listed
- **Understand permissions** - note that only owners can invite new members

## Inviting Members to Your Project

As a project owner, you can invite others to collaborate. However, there's an **important requirement**: you must **publish your project to the cloud** before you can invite members.

### Understanding Local vs Cloud Projects

When viewing your projects, you'll notice:

- **Local icon** 📍 - Indicates the project is stored only on your device
- **Cloud icon** ☁️ - Indicates the project can be synced or uploaded to the cloud
- **No local icon** - The project has already been published to the cloud

### Publishing to the Cloud

Before inviting members, you need to publish your project:

1. **Open your project** (for example, "Curens Bible Project")
2. **Navigate to a chapter or content section** that has assets/recordings
3. Look for the **cloud icon with uploader** next to the edit button
4. **Click "Save to cloud"** or similar button
5. **Understand what happens**:
   - Creates a **permanent copy** in the cloud (e.g., Matthew 1)
   - All recordings are saved in an **immutable snapshot**
   - Once saved, **this version cannot be changed** (but you can create new versions)
   - If the **parent book or project** hasn't been saved yet, they'll be **saved automatically**

After publishing, you'll notice the **local icon disappears** from your project, indicating it's now available in the cloud.

### Sending Invitations (Project Owners Only)

Once your project is published to the cloud, you can invite users:

1. **Load your project** from the project list
2. **Open the menu** in the **bottom right corner**
3. **Select "Invite Members"** or the invite option
4. **Enter the user's email address**
5. **Choose membership level** - select regular member or owner
6. **Send the invitation** - the system handles delivery

#### Invitation Delivery:
- **Existing LangQuest users**: Receive immediate in-app notifications
- **New users**: Receive email invitations that activate once they create accounts

### Accepting Invitations

When you receive a project invitation:

- **Check your notifications** - invitations appear in your notification center
- **Review the project details** - understand what you're being invited to join
- **Choose download preferences** - decide if you want to download the project immediately
  - **Download enabled**: You can contribute offline
  - **Download disabled**: You can only contribute while online
- **Accept or decline** - make your decision and confirm

## Project Privacy Management

### Changing Project Privacy (Owners Only)

Project owners can modify privacy settings:

- **Access project settings** - click the settings cog icon
- **Toggle privacy status** - switch between public and private
- **Understand the impact**:
  - **Making private**: Only members can contribute (lock icon appears)
  - **Making public**: Anyone can contribute (lock icon disappears)

### Privacy Status Indicators

- **Lock icon on project card**: Indicates a private project
- **No lock icon**: Indicates a public project
- **Member/owner badges**: Show your role in each project

---

## Best Practices

### For Project Owners:
- **Publish to the cloud first** before inviting members - this is required for collaboration
- **Review membership requests promptly** to keep contributors engaged
- **Be thoughtful about privacy settings** - consider your project's goals
- **Invite trusted contributors** to maintain quality
- **Use owner privileges wisely** - consider promoting active members to co-owners
- **Understand immutability** - published versions cannot be changed, but you can create new versions

### For Members:
- **Respect project privacy** - understand that private projects have membership requirements
- **Contribute meaningfully** once you gain access
- **Download projects** if you plan to work offline
- **Engage with notifications** - respond to invitations and requests promptly
- **Use both request methods** - try the top center button in All Projects or the menu in bottom right corner

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Can't Contribute to a Project?
- Check if the project is private (lock icon present)
- Ensure you're a member of the project
- Request membership using one of the two methods (top center or bottom right menu)

### Not Receiving Invitations?
- Check your notification center in-app
- Verify your email address is correct
- Check spam folder for email invitations

### Can't Invite Members?
- **Confirm the project is published to the cloud** - this is required before inviting
- Look for the cloud icon with uploader - if present, you need to save to cloud first
- Confirm you're a project owner (not just a member)
- Check that the local icon has disappeared from your project (indicates cloud publishing)
- Ensure you're accessing your own project's membership modal

### Can't Find Request Membership Button?
- Try the **top center of the screen** in All Projects view
- Or use the **menu in bottom right corner** → membership icon at top
- Ensure the project allows membership requests

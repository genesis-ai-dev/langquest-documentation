description: Step-by-step guide to uploading existing content into LangQuest using a CSV file, so you don't have to abondon useful data
---

## Who This Guide Is For

If you've already been working on translation content **outside of LangQuest** — in spreadsheets, documents, or other tools — you can import it directly into LangQuest rather than re-entering everything by hand.

This guide walks you through the entire upload process from start to finish.

---

## Step 1: Go to the LangQuest Website and Open the User Area

Navigate to [langquest.org](https://langquest.org) in your browser. In the top-right corner of the page, click the **"User Area"** button.

## Step 2: Sign In to Your Account

You'll be taken to the **Project Management Dashboard** login screen. Enter the **email address and password** you used when you signed up for LangQuest, then click **Login**.

⚠️ **Note:** You must use the same email you registered with. If you don't have an account yet, click **Register** to create one first.

---

## Step 3: Click "Upload Project" on Your Dashboard

Once logged in, you'll see your **Project Management Dashboard** listing all your existing LangQuest projects. In the top-right of the **Your Projects** section, click the **"Upload Project"** button.

## Step 4: Review the ZIP File Format Requirements

A popup will appear explaining the required format for your upload. Before selecting a file, read through these requirements carefully so your upload is structured correctly. 

To speed you along, download the template .csv file by clicking the button:

### ZIP File Format

Your ZIP file must contain:

- **One CSV file** with your project data — [**Download CSV Template**](/templates/project-upload-template.csv) to get the correct column structure, or click the **"Download CSV Template"** button inside the popup
- **Image files** (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`) referenced in the CSV
- **Audio files** (`.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.wav`, `.ogg`) referenced in the CSV

### Formatting Rules

- Tags, source content, and source audio must be separated by **semicolons (`;`)** if there is more than one
- All files (CSV and media) must be placed inside an **`assets` folder** within the ZIP archive
- Avoid using special characters in file names
- Ensure the CSV references media files correctly by their filenames
- Quests without a parent name, or with a non-existent parent name, will be placed at the **root of the project**
- The maximum allowed ZIP file size is **50MB**

## Step 5: Select Your ZIP File and Upload

Scroll down in the popup to the **"Select ZIP File"** section. Click **"Browse..."** to open your computer's file picker and choose your prepared ZIP file.

Once you've selected your file, click **"Upload ZIP File"** to begin the import. LangQuest will process your CSV and media files and create the project automatically.

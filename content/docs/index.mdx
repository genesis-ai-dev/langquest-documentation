# Welcome to LangQuest! 🌍

Built for the realities of field translation—LangQuest was born from a simple need: a reliable way to capture oral Bible translations and more, even in the most remote conditions.

When laptops fail in heat or humidity 🥵💻, when internet is unreliable for months 📶❌, when the work is too important to lose 🛡️—LangQuest is there. It's designed to handle real-world conditions: offline-first 📡, resilient 💪, and simple to use on everyday mobile devices 📱.

## What You Can Do

### 🗣️ Translate Easily
Capture short, meaningful chunks of Scripture, stories, songs, or cultural content (even with images!)—using your own language, by voice or text.

### 📖 Scripture First, Not Scripture Only
LangQuest is already being used to translate the Bible, but it's built for more: traditional stories, oral histories, and educational materials.

### 💬 Collaborate and Validate
Vote on translations, provide feedback, and reach consensus through your community. Every contribution matters.

### 📡 Offline-First, Seamless Sync
Store quests and projects locally. Work offline for weeks or months, then sync automatically when back online.

### 🌍 Open, Public, and Purposeful
Your contributions become part of a global open-access dataset—freely usable for language preservation, research, and AI training. No strings attached.

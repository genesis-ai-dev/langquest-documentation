# LangQuest

Internal mobile app for collaborative language translation.

## Getting set up

1. Clone repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/genesis-ai-dev/langquest.git
```

2. Switch to the dev branch:

```bash
git checkout dev
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

4. **To obtain the .env file**, request an invite from an existing admin developer to the existing eten-genesis expo organization (secrets required the the APK build to be built in EAS are in the organization)
  ![EAS Login](/readme_images/eas_login.jpg)

Obtain the .env file by logging into EAS and running the `eas env:pull <production|preview|development>` command, and change the newly created `.env.local` file to `.env`.

5. If you're using a physical android device, enable USB debugging before connecting to your machine:

   - Go to Settings > About phone
   - Tap "Build number" seven times to become a developer
   - Return to Settings > System > Developer options
   - Enable "USB debugging"

6. Run the app by following the [Expo environment setup guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/) for your platform, **with the supplemental pointers below**:

- Recommended to run on physical android device (emulator may have minimal limitations but should allow for most functionality)

![Android Device](/readme_images/android_device.jpg)

- Choose **Development build** (not Expo Go)

### There are two ways to run the app:

#### 1. EAS Development Build (`eas build --platform android --profile development`)

![EAS Build](/readme_images/yes_eas.jpg)

- Creates a standalone development **APK**
- Can be installed and run without computer connection
- Includes development tools but packaged as installable app
- Builds in Expo's cloud infrastructure (no local SDK needed)
- Takes longer to build but can be shared with team members
- Requires EAS account and configuration

- To see the console log output from the APK, run

```bash
adb logcat --pid=$(adb shell pidof -s com.etengenesis.langquest)
```

#### 2. Local Development (`npm run android`)

![Local Build](/readme_images/no_eas.jpg)

- Runs the app directly on your connected Android device/emulator
- Enables real-time code updates (hot reload)
- Requires USB connection or local network connection
- Includes development tools and debugging features
- Faster build times for testing changes
- Requires local Android SDK setup

## Local Development Environment

> To disable the local environment and use the cloud environment instead, delete your `.env.local` file.

### Prerequisites

- Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (docker compose version 4.24.0 or greater required)

### Running Local Services

- Run this command to run your local dev environment (Cmd/Ctrl+C to stop or run `npm run env:stop`):

  ```bash
  npm run env
  ```

- In another terminal, run the app as normal:

  ```bash
  npm run android
  ```

- Run this command **if necessary** to reset your local dev environment (please make sure its running first):

  ```bash
  npm run env:clean
  ```

### Usage

#### Making Database Changes

1. Access the Supabase Studio at [http://localhost:54323](http://localhost:54323).

2. Modify tables & columns in the Table Editor and/or SQL Editor.

   > For **any new database tables** you create, make sure to toggle its 'powersync' [publication](http://localhost:54323/project/default/database/publications) before diffing database changes, so that PowerSync can replicate the tables.

3. Update the local drizzle schema in `db/drizzleSchema.ts` to reflect the changes you made.

4. Generate a migration file with a descriptive name to describe your changes:

   ```bash
   npm run supabase:migration:diff -- "your_migration_description"
   ```

   > This creates a timestamped SQL migration file in the `supabase/migrations` directory. The script automatically handles storage permissions issues during migration generation.

   - For **any new database tables** you create, add a publication statement for each new table, to the end of the new migration file that was just created [(hopefully this will be automatic at some point)](https://github.com/supabase/cli/issues/883):

     ```sql
     alter publication "powersync" add table only "<schema>"."<table_name>";
     ```

5. (Optional) If you want to preserve any test data you've inserted across database resets (recommended if adding new tables or columns), run this command to save your local database's current data:

   ```bash
   npx supabase@beta db dump --local --schema public --data-only > supabase/seeds/public.sql
   ```

   This creates a SQL file containing all the data from your local database's public schema, which will be automatically loaded when you reset your database using `npm run env:clean`.

6. Review the generated migration file to ensure it captures your intended changes.

7. Commit the migration file to your repository to track database schema changes.

> **Note**: If you need to repair the migration history table to match local migration files (for example, if migrations appear as reverted when they shouldn't be), you can run the following:

ensure you've linked your project to the cloud:
```
supabase link --project-ref unsxkmlcyxgtgmtzfonb --password [ask project admin for password]
```

Enter supabase password (get from a developer)

Run this command to get your credentials:
Get HOST and PASSWORD
```
supabase branches get --experimental 
```

Run the reverted command and the applied commands
> ```bash
> npx supabase@beta migration repair --status reverted --db-url "postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]:5432/postgres"
> npx supabase@beta migration repair --status applied --db-url "postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]:5432/postgres"
> ```
> This will prompt you to confirm repairing the entire migration history table to match your local migration files.
The reverted command clears the remote migration history (clears records).
The applied command applies the local migration files into the remote.

#### Making Sync Rule Changes

1. Edit the sync rules configuration in `/supabase/config/sync_rules.yml`.

> If your local environment is running already, PowerSync will auto restart when you make changes to the sync rules. Otherwise just start the environment and changes will be reflected accordingly.

### Common issue during setup:

```bash
Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugMainManifest'.
> Manifest merger failed : uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 23 cannot be smaller than version 24 declared in library [:journeyapps_react-native-quick-sqlite]
```

To resolve this:

1. Delete package-lock.json and node_modules folder
2. Remove root android folder
3. Run `npm i`
4. Run `npx expo prebuild --clean` to regenerate the android folder with correct configuration
5. Try building the app again

## Offline Testing on Physical Device (Android)

This setup allows you to test the app on a physical Android device while it's completely offline (no WiFi or mobile data), while still getting real-time logs over USB and supporting hot reloading.

### Prerequisites
- Android device with USB debugging enabled.
- ADB installed and device connected via USB (run `adb devices` to verify).
- Run `npm run android` once while online to install the dev client.

### Steps
1. Build and install the app on the phone (while phone is online):
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

2. Once installation is complete, end the process (Ctrl+C).

3. Start the Expo dev server locally:
   ```bash
   npm run start -- --localhost --android
   ```
   - Do **not** press `a` to run on Android yet.
   - If port 8081 is in use, add `--port 8082` (and adjust the reverse command below).

4. In a new terminal, set up ADB reverse proxy for USB tunneling:
   ```bash
   adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
   ```
   - This enables the phone to access the dev server via localhost over USB.

5. Set your device to offline (disable data and WiFi).

6. Open the freshly installed app on your phone.

7. On the "development servers" page, manually enter:
   ```
   http://localhost:8081
   ```
   - Tap to connect. The app should load via the USB tunnel.

### Viewing Logs
The logs should be visible in the terminal used to run the npm run start command. If not follow the instructions below.
In another terminal:
```bash
adb logcat | grep "ReactNative"
```
- Or use `adb logcat` for all logs.

This setup supports hot reloading over USB without any network on the phone.
